One of the most frequent complaints about canine behaviour is barking. 
Aside from the biting dog, the barking dog is probably the pet peeve of many non-dog owners. 
I know of at least one city in which owners of dogs that bark excessively, and for which 
there are complaints on file, are required to take steps to eliminate the barking. Canine
practitioners are drawn into problems with barking when they are asked for their advice in 
helping and owner come up with a solution or, as a last resort, when they are requested to 
perform a debarking operation or even euthanasia. In this column I will deal with some of 
the factors that apparently cause dogs to bark and suggest some corrective approaches.
